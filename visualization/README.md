# Visualizing Training with DJL

This module contains UI TrainingListener that provides training visualization UI.

Currently, implemented features:

- Training/Validating progress
- Training Metrics Visualization chart

## Prerequisites

* You need to have Java Development Kit version 11 or later installed on your system.
* You should be familiar with the API documentation in the DJL [Javadoc](https://javadoc.djl.ai/api/0.4.0/index.html).

### Install the Java Development Kit
For ubuntu:

```shell script
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk-headless
```
For centos:

```shell script
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
```
For macOS:

```shell script
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew update
brew cask install adoptopenjdk11
```


You can also download and install [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html)
manually if you have trouble with the previous commands.

If you have multiple versions of Java installed, you can use the $JAVA_HOME environment
variable to control which version of Java to use.
