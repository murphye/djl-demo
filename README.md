An example application detects malicious urls based on a trained Character Level CNN model.

## [Live Object Detection](live-object-detection/README.md)

An example application detects live objects from web camera.

## [Visualizing Training with DJL](visualization/README.md)

An example application features a web UI to track and visualize metrics such as loss and accuracy.

## [Pneumonia Detection](pneumonia-detection/README.md)

An example application detects Pneumonia based on X-ray images using a trained Keras model.

## [AWS Kinesis Video Streams](aws-kinesis-video-streams/README.md)
